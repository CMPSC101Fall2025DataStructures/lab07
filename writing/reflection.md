## 1. Data Loading and Validation Understanding

**Question:** Explain in your own words why it is important to validate data after loading it from a CSV file. What kinds of problems might you encounter with real-world data, and how does your program handle these issues?

**Your Answer:**

TODO

## 2. Statistical Transformations and Their Purpose

**Question:** You implemented three different statistical transformations: logarithmic (log), exponential (exp), and square root (sqrt). Choose one transformation and explain when and why you would use it in real data analysis. Give a specific example of a dataset where this transformation would be helpful.

**Your Answer:**

## 3. Debugging and Problem Solving Experience

**Question:** Describe the most challenging TODO you encountered while completing this assignment. What was the error message or problem, and how did you resolve the error? What debugging strategies did you use?

**Your Answer:**

TODO

---

## 4. Data Visualization Impact

**Question:** Compare how the same dataset looked before and after applying a statistical transformation in your plots. What patterns or insights became more visible after the transformation? Why do you think data scientists use visualizations to understand data?

**Your Answer:**

TODO

## 5. Pandas vs. Manual Data Processing

**Question:** In this assignment, you used the pandas library to work with CSV files and numerical data. How do you think this compares to trying to process the same data manually (without pandas)? What advantages does pandas provide for data analysis?

**Your Answer:**

TODO

## 6. Error Handling and Edge Cases

**Question:** Your program had to handle several edge cases, such as negative numbers in logarithmic transformations or very large numbers in exponential transformations. Why is it important to consider these edge cases in data analysis programs? Give an example of what could go wrong without proper error handling.

**Your Answer:**

TODO

## 7. Modular Programming Benefits

**Question:** The main.py file was organized into separate functions for different tasks (loading data, transformations, plotting, etc.). How did this modular approach help you while debugging and completing the TODOs? What would have been different if all the code was in one large function?

**Your Answer:**

TODO

## 8. Real-World Applications

**Question:** Choose one of the sample datasets (temperature, population, or stock prices) and explain how the type of analysis you performed in this lab could be useful in the real world. Who might use this analysis and what decisions might they make based on the results?

**Your Answer:**

TODO


---

## 9. Data Quality and Trust

**Question:** When working with the CSV files, you had to validate that they contained numerical data. In real-world scenarios, data can come from many sources and may have quality issues. What questions would you ask about a dataset before trusting it for important analysis?

**Your Answer:**

TODO


---

## 10. Visualization Design Choices

**Question:** Your program creates different types of plots (line plots, comparison plots, etc.). What makes a good data visualization? If you were presenting your analysis results to someone who is not familiar with programming, how would you explain what the plots show?

**Your Answer:**

TODO

## 11. Learning and Challenge Reflection

**Question:** What was the most surprising thing you learned about data analysis or Python programming while completing this assignment? What concept that seemed difficult at first became clearer as you worked through the TODOs?

**Your Answer:**

TODO

---

## 12. Future Extensions and Improvements

**Question:** If you had more time to work on this project, what additional features or improvements would you add? How might you extend the program to analyze different types of data or create more advanced visualizations?

**Your Answer:**

TODO
